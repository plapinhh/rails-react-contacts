# Factorial Technical test
The goal of the application is to have some working code that can be presented in front of the development team. In order to do so, we are going to ask for a very simple app that has backend and client with emphasis in quality.

## Specification
We want a React + Backend application that allows you to create, read, update and delete a list of contacts.
Each contact will have: First name, Last name, Email and phone number. All the fields are mandatory and there canâ€™t be two contacts with the same email. The contacts will be persisted in the database.
